# Class


### Define
It is a user define data type which holds its own data members and member functions which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class


## Example

Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with different names and brands but all of them will share some common properties like all of them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range, etc. So here, the Car is the class, and wheels, speed limits, and mileage are their properties.
